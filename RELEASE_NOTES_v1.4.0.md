## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

   - **Impact**: Portfolio clicks crashed the website
   - **Solution**: Reverted from manual FocusTrap to DialogContent from shadcn/ui
   - **Result**: Lightbox opens/closes without errors

2. **Invisible Service Cards** (Commit: e9747e8)
   - **Issue**: Service cards invisible when "View All Services" button clicked
   - **Impact**: Users couldn't see or interact with additional services
   - **Solution**: Fixed fallback image placeholder logic to show when images fail
   - **Result**: All service cards visible with proper fallback icons

3. **Portfolio Click Crashes** (Commit: 83ec57b)
   - **Issue**: Clicking portfolio items would crash the website
   - **Impact**: Portfolio feature unusable
   - **Solution**: Added error handling and index validation
   - **Result**: Portfolio items open in lightbox without errors

4. **Environment Configuration** (Commit: 8c043ed)
   - **Issue**: `.env.local` override with wrong projectId prevented Sanity connection
   - **Impact**: Services and Portfolio showed no items
