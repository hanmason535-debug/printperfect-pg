# üöÄ Setup New Public Repository for Lovable

## Steps to Create New Public Repo on GitHub

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Fastest)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

   - **Description**: UI Improvement Sandbox for PrintPerfect - Ready for Lovable
   - **Visibility**: Public
   - **Initialize**: NO (don't create README, gitignore, license)

3. **After creating**, GitHub will show you commands. Run these:

```bash
cd "d:\Paras Print Perfect Project\printperfect-ui-improvement"

# Add the new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/printperfect-ui-improvement.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push all content
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open the cloned directory with GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Publish Repository"
3. Give it a name: `printperfect-ui-improvement`
4. Add description: "UI Improvement Sandbox for PrintPerfect - Ready for Lovable"
5. Make sure "Keep this code private" is UNCHECKED
6. Click "Publish"
